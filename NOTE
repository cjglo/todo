- A lot of magic numbers and strings that could be removed and labelled
- a lot of unwraps and crashing with no handling
- ||| in a reminder would mess it up, maybe a better safe guard for this.  Its a special string for this program but arguably isn't that unique
- scheduled timer like slack, idea being that you can get regularly pinged.  Requires this to run at start-up
- a config for colors
- better flag handling that isn't so rigid
- backup reminders? On panic, can revert
- Change all stuff to RON
- sort so that things with due date are always on top
